# Connect4
## About
This is my CSC590 Connect4 project which was defined so that we would collect requirements from a costumer and then design and implement them. The project is written in swift and designed to be run on a Mac. To play the game, select the number of bots you want to use and click begin game. Then click in the middle of a square to place your piece there. The reset button clears the game and the game setup button returns to the Home Screen. If youâ€™re not certain how to play Connect4, then click on the help button to go to a wiki how article. 

## Given Requirements
- Mac App (swift in Xcode) 
- One character is a smiley emoji ðŸ˜ƒ, the other is a triangle ðŸ”º \*
- The game should be animated (like confetti when you win), can be completed using SwiftUI \*
- 1 Player \*
- Controlled by the keyboard (arrow keys)
- Random bot to play against 
- Black and white color scheme
