# Connect4
## About
This is my CSC590 Connect4 project which was defined so that we would collect requirements from a costumer and then design and implement them. The project is written in swift and designed to be run on a Mac. To play the game, select the number of bots you want to use and click begin game. Then click in the middle of a square to place your piece there. The reset button clears the game and the game setup button returns to the Home Screen. If youâ€™re not certain how to play Connect4, then click on the help button to go to a wiki how article. 

## Known Issues
When confetti appears on the screen, the message `NSHostingView is being laid out reentrantly while rendering its SwiftUI content. This is not supported and the current layout pass will be skipped`. might appear. This is a bug in the Apple library I am using and thus not fixable by me.
There is another error when playing bot vs. bot and tapping reset really fast. This creates a `BAD_ACCESS` fatal error in the bot code. The cause of this is unkown, but my guess is it's a flaw in the random number generator. This was a very niche case and bot vs. bot was not in the requirements, so this issue is still in progress.

## Given Requirements
- Mac App (swift in Xcode) 
- One character is a smiley emoji ðŸ˜ƒ, the other is a triangle ðŸ”º \*
- The game should be animated (like confetti when you win), can be completed using SwiftUI \*
- 1 Player \*
- Controlled by the keyboard (arrow keys)
- Random bot to play against 
- Black and white color scheme
